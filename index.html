            <p>Sometimes I look at the sky and I think about what my life could have been. Then I get vertigo and stopped looking at the sky because it hurts my eyes.</p>
            <p>I have always been passionate about having an enjoyable time wherever I go and thus I would love to learn how to be better at programming. However,
                no one told me that life was gonna be this way.
